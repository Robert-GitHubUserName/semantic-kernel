â”œâ”€â”€ static/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ css/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ style.css          (Now 585 lines - comprehensive styles)
â””â”€â”€ templates/
    â””â”€â”€ ai_researcher.html     (Now 1148 lines - clean HTML only)
```

## Next Steps

### Potential Improvements
1. **CSS Variables** - Extract color palette into CSS custom properties
2. **Media Queries** - Add more responsive breakpoints
3. **Animations** - Enhance transitions and effects
4. **Dark/Light Mode** - Add theme toggle support
5. **Component Library** - Break into modular CSS files

### Testing
- âœ… Verify all pages load correctly
- âœ… Check responsive design
- âœ… Test in different browsers
- âœ… Validate CSS syntax

## Usage

The external CSS file is now automatically loaded via Flask's `url_for()` function:
```html
<link href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/style.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
```

This ensures the correct path is used regardless of deployment environment.
